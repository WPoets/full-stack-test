Question 1: How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I spent approximately 2 hours on the coding test. Given more time, I would focus on the following improvements:

Enhanced Validation: Implement more robust input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users and log errors for troubleshooting purposes.

User Authentication: Integrate user authentication for secure access to CRUD functionality.

Code Refactoring: Optimize and refactor the code for better readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.

Question 2: How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

Monitoring Tools: Utilize monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or built-in server monitoring to identify any anomalies in resource usage, response times, and throughput.

Logging: Analyze server logs and application logs to pinpoint any specific errors or patterns that may be causing performance degradation.

Database Profiling: Examine database query performance using tools like MySQL's EXPLAIN statement or ORM-specific profiling tools.

Code Profiling: Use profiling tools such as Xdebug or built-in profilers in frameworks to identify bottlenecks in the application code.

Load Testing: Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify how the system performs under stress.

Question 3: Please describe yourself using JSON.
