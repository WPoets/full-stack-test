Question  1) 8 hours. I created two seperated views. If I had more time then I'd try to give design in the same view with some resposive css techniques.  

Question 2) If there will be a performance issue in production then the first thing to check is are all the servers and processes working normally. Network Speed. Poorly written code. Slow servers and unwanted javascript code and html tags. These are some main reasons of the Performance. There is Gzip compression technique to reduce the size of the data fetching from server. I will prefer CDN for better availability of repositories. 

Question 3)
