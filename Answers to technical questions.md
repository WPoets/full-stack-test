Question  1) 8 hours. I created two seperated views. If I had more time then I'd try to give design in the same view with some resposive css techniques.  

Question 2) If there will be a performance issue in production then the first thing to check is are all the servers and processes working normally. Then is there any errors displaying by display error='ON'. Then any browser consol log errors. And then check the php code by adding die statement after some points where it not works. And there are lot of techniques.

Question 3)
